# Bayesian-Model-ML
# Derive and implement bayesian predictive model on the datasets. Currently, the implementation include posterior
# Matrix factorization using Expectation Maximization algorithm to make binary prediction on Data set with significant missing values
# Variational inference to approximate a distribution on the data set that is generated through a certain probability       distribution
